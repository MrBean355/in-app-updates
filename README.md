## Note About Testing
In-app updates are very tricky to test; see the [official docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/test) for more info.

If you build & run this demo app, you **WILL NOT** see a prompt to download a new version.
This is because the app needs to be signed with the same certificate as the one on the Play Store.
